# Rust-Python interoperability

Welcome to **"Rust-Python interoperability"**!

In this course, you'll learn how to write Rust code that can be called from Python,
using `pyo3` to create Python extension modules.

We assume you are familiar with the basics of both Rust and Python, but we don't assume any prior interoperability knowledge.
We will provide explanations and references whenever we rely on advanced features in either language.

## Getting started

Open [the companion book for this course](https://rust-exercises.com/rust-python-interop/) in your browser.
Follow the instructions there to get started.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (follow instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).\
  If `rustup` is already installed on your system, run `rustup update` (or another appropriate command depending on how
  you installed Rust on your system)
  to make sure you're running on the latest stable version.
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An IDE with Rust autocompletion support.
  We recommend one of the following:
  - [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/);
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
    the [`rust-analyzer`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer) extension.
- **Rye** curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash
