// TODO: Define a base class named `Discount`, with a `percentage` attribute.
//  It should be possible to access the `percentage` attribute of a `Discount`.
//  It should also be possible to modify the `percentage` attribute of a `Discount`.
//  It must be enforced that the `percentage` attribute is a float between 0. and 1.
//  Then define two subclasses:
//  - `SeasonalDiscount` that inherits from `Discount` with two additional attributes, `to` and `from_`.
//    `from_` is a datetime object that represents the start of the discount period.
//    `to` is a datetime object that represents the end of the discount period.
//     Both `from_` and `to` should be accessible and modifiable.
//     The class should enforce that `from` is before `to`.
//  - `CappedDiscount` that inherits from `Discount` with an additional attribute `cap`.
//    `cap` is a float that represents the maximum discount (in absolute value) that can be applied.
//    It should be possible to access and modify the `cap` attribute.
//    The class should enforce that `cap` is a non-zero positive float.
//
// All classes should have a method named `apply` that takes a price (float) as input and
// returns the discounted price.
// `SeasonalDiscount` should raise an `ExpiredDiscount` exception if `apply` is called but
// the current date is outside the discount period.
